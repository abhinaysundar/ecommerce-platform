**E-commerce Platform (Microservices-Based)**

## Overview

An online shopping platform where users can browse products, add to cart, place orders, and make payments.

Architecture & Microservices

1. User Service: Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles.
2. Product Service: Handles product catalog, categories, and inventory.
3. Order Service: Manages cart, order creation, and order status.
4. Payment Service: Integrates with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
5. Notification Service: Sends emails/SMS for order confirmation.
6. API Gateway: Routes requests to appropriate microservices.

Tech Stack

1. Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Hibernate, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Kafka/RabbitMQ.
2. Frontend: React, Redux, Axios, Bootstrap.
3. Authentication: Spring Security with JWT.
4. Containerization & Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP.

Steps to Implement

1. Set up microservices: Create Spring Boot projects for each service.
2. Configure Database: Design schemas and use JPA for ORM.
3. Implement API Gateway: Use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing.
4. Integrate Messaging: Use Kafka for asynchronous event handling.
5. Develop Frontend: Build React UI for user interaction.
6. Secure with Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication.
7. Deploy with Docker & Kubernetes.
